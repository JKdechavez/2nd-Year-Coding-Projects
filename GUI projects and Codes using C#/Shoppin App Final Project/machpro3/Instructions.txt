1. Only one admin account was created in database. There are no options for adding admin account because users are only eligible as customers. To add admin account, kindly add a new account into MySql table named "users". See password and account details in "users".
2. All product photos are contained in Project Solutions' bin folder so that it can be easily called by the program using their filename only.
3. Change all of the passwords of the database in the solutions' code. Don't forget database class file. Almost every form contains the string connection, make sure to change eveything.
